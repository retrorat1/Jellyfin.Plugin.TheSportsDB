## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setting up your API Key

1. Get a free API key from [TheSportsDB.com](https://www.thesportsdb.com/)
2. Go to **Dashboard > Plugins > TheSportsDB**
3. Enter your **API Key**
4. Click **Save**
5. **Note**: Jellyfin will restart automatically after saving configuration changes (this is normal behavior)

### League Mappings

The plugin includes built-in support for popular leagues (see [Known Leagues](#-known-leagues-built-in) below). For custom or abbreviated folder names that aren't automatically detected, you can create manual mappings:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Plugins > TheSportsDB**
2. Scroll to **League Mappings**
3. Click **Add Mapping**
4. Enter your **Folder Name** — This is just the folder name (e.g., `EPL`, `Süper Lig`), **NOT** the full path
5. Enter the **TheSportsDB League ID** (e.g., `4339` for Süper Lig)
   - You can find League IDs in the URL of the league page on TheSportsDB.com
6. Click **Save**
7. **Note**: Saving configuration will restart Jellyfin (this is normal)
8. Rescan your library

## 📝 Recommended File Naming Guide

**This is the most important section for getting great results!** The plugin parses filenames to match against TheSportsDB events, so naming conventions have a huge impact on match accuracy.

### Best Formats (by Match Rate)

| Format | Example | Match Rate |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `YYYY-MM-DD Team1 vs Team2` | `2026-02-08 Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-ABBR-ABBR` | `2026-02-05-NJD-NYI.mkv` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `Team1 vs Team2` | `Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `Full Event Name` | `UFC 315 Jones vs Aspinall.mkv` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `YYYY Team1 vs Team2 DD MM` | `2026 Liverpool vs Manchester City 08 02.mkv` | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| `League YYYY Team1 vs Team2 DD MM codec` | `EPL 2026 Liverpool vs Manchester City 08 02 720p.mkv` | ⭐⭐ |

### Key Naming Rules

- **✅ Always use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD)** when possible — This avoids DD/MM vs MM/DD ambiguity entirely
- **✅ Use full team names** where possible (e.g., "Liverpool" not "LIV", "Manchester City" not "MCI")
- **✅ Use `vs` as the separator** between team names — This matches TheSportsDB's event naming convention
- **✅ Keep the folder name as the league abbreviation** (e.g., `EPL`, `NHL`, `NBA`, `UFC`)
- **✅ Avoid scene tags in filenames** if possible — Remove `720p`, `1080p`, `Fubo`, `60fps`, `x265`, `HEVC`, etc. The plugin tries to strip these, but cleaner names = better results
- **✅ Season folders should contain the year(s)** — Use `Season 2025-26` or `Season 2025-2026`
- **✅ Team abbreviations work best for NHL** and other leagues with standard 3-letter codes (e.g., `NJD`, `NYI`, `EDM`, `PIT`)
- **✅ For soccer/football, use full team names** — Abbreviations like `LIV` or `MCI` are less standardized internationally

## 🔧 How the Plugin Works

The plugin uses a sophisticated matching pipeline to find the correct metadata for your sports files:

1. **Derive Series/League Name**: Extracts the league name from your folder structure
2. **Resolve League ID**: Searches for the league ID in this order:
   - User-configured League Mappings
   - Built-in internal league map (NHL, EPL, NFL, NBA, MLB, UFC)
   - Local sports_resolver.db database
   - TheSportsDB API search (as last resort)
3. **Clean the Filename**: Removes dates, league prefixes, and scene tags from the filename
4. **Expand Team Abbreviations**: Converts common abbreviations to full team names (e.g., MTL → Montreal Canadiens)
5. **Search TheSportsDB API**: Searches for matching events using the cleaned team names
6. **Date-Based Fallback**: If no match is found, falls back to date-based lookup with ±1 day tolerance (to handle timezone differences)

## 🏆 Known Leagues (Built-in)

The following leagues have built-in support and don't require manual mapping:

| League | League ID | Sport |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| NHL | 4380 | Ice Hockey 🏒 |
| EPL | 4328 | Soccer ⚽ |
| NFL | 4391 | American Football 🏈 |
| NBA | 4387 | Basketball 🏀 |
| MLB | 4424 | Baseball ⚾ |
| UFC | 4463 | Mixed Martial Arts 🥊 |

**Note**: ANY league on TheSportsDB can be used via the League Mappings configuration. These are just the ones that work automatically without configuration.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"No metadata found" or Empty Results**
- Check your filename format — Try using ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Verify the event exists on TheSportsDB.com
- Check your API key is correctly configured
- Try using full team names instead of abbreviations

**"Season Unknown"**
- Ensure your Season folder contains the year (e.g., `Season 2025-26` or `Season 2025-2026`)
- Check that the parent folder matches a known league or has a mapping configured

**"Logs stop after saving configuration"**
- This is normal! Jellyfin automatically restarts after configuration changes
- Wait 30-60 seconds for Jellyfin to restart, then check your library

**"Wrong match found" or Incorrect Metadata**
- Use more specific filenames with ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Include full team names rather than abbreviations
- Verify the teams/event names match what's on TheSportsDB.com

**Plugin doesn't recognize my league folder (e.g., "Bundesliga", "La Liga")**
- Add a League Mapping in the plugin configuration
- Find the League ID by visiting the league page on TheSportsDB.com and checking the URL
- The League ID is the number in the URL: `https://www.thesportsdb.com/league/4331` → League ID = `4331`
